# linear-alg

This repository contains Java implementations of algorithms designed to help understand the maths in my computer science courses.

## About

- All code is written in Java.
- Focuses on algorithms related to linear algebra and mathematical foundations relevant to computer science.

## Structure
- Each algorithm or concept is organized as a separate Java file or directory.
  
## Usage

- Browse the repo to review Java implementations of various algorithms. (not alot currently, but will add over the course of my degree)
- To run or test a file, compile it using:
    ```sh
    javac FileName.java
    java FileName
    ```
  (Replace `FileName` with the actual class name containing the `main` method.)
